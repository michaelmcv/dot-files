# Fork of Ben Hoskings dotfiles

Discovered Ben's terminal setup rom an advanced git course on pluralsight. I liked the git branch and commit info ont the right hand side of the terminal. Also has some nice aliases set up for useful git commands, e.g. gla.

Updated with some of my own personal commands, but virutally the same as Ben's original
